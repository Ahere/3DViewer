How to use:
1-Create a new material. 
    In the Project Dialog, right click on the folder where you want to create the material (usually in the Materials folder), then Choose Create>Material.
2-Click on the material to show its properties in the inspector. In the Shader section, choose Wireframe>Wireframe.
3-Drag and drop the material on the object you want to apply on in the scene.

Parameter Description:
*Wireframe Color:
   The color that will be used to display vertices and edges.
*Line Width:
   Defines the width of the wireframe edges
*Line Width Distance Wise:
  Deactivate if you want the line width to remain the same on screen when the camera distance to the object varies. 
*Frame Sharpness:
  Slide to modify line style. A value of 0 draws ordinary lines. A value of 0.5 draws a diamond.
*Gradient Texture:
   Texture used to define the color gradient. It uses the gradient.png texture (in the Texture folder). 
* Color Gradient:
   Activate to use color gradient. Otherwise, will draw vertices and edges using plain colors.
*Vertice Size:
  Control the size of the vertices
*Attenuate Backfaces:
  Activate if you want the wireframe of the faces facing away from the camera to be drawn with a darker color. Makes the wireframe more coherent.
*Backface Attenuation:
  Controls the darkness of the wireframe at the backfaces. Requires the “Attenuate Backfaces” parameter to be activated.
